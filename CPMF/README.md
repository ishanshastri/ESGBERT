## Demonstration of strategies using Transformers for Timeseries Forecasting

Autoformer (https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13008): Demonstration of how to build, train and test a huggingface autoformer on multivariate energy data (hourly spanish energy data)

Chronos (https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815): Demonstration of how to download a chronos timeseries foundation model and perform zero-shot predictions on timeseries: air ticket demand and a custom dataset (hourly spanish energy)

Binned Predictor: An attempt to leverage quantization and normalization to make a trainable timeseries model on your custom dataset; Conceptually similar to Chronos
